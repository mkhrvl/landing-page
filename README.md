# Project: Landing Page

## Objective/s
This project aims to test and solidify my knowledge on HTML and CSS that I have acquired throughout the Odin Project's **[Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)**. This is a step up from the previous project as it requires intermediate level knowledge of CSS.

## Lessons Learned
- Semantic HTML is important especially in terms of SEO.
- Flexbox is an important tool in creating responsive and dynamic layouts.
- Following a convention such as BEM can help with code readability.
- CSS variables are a huge time saver as you don't have to change every value in each declaration manually.
- Work in sections as to not get overwhelmed.

## Things to Improve Upon
- I have difficulty in creating a more robust responsive layout.
- When using flex, elements are spread too apart when zooming out. As such, the layout would not look good on a wide monitor/screen.
- Again, commit messages need more work. Focus on the why not the how.
